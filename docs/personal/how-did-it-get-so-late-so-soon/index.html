                    <p>Another year is about to end and yet it seems it has just started. At the start of 2015, I had ambitious plans for the year. A lot of things to do, a plethora of resolutions, and a heart brimming with optimism. The year is about to conclude and I&rsquo;m afraid that I&rsquo;m far from my plans. I had fallen in the trap of <em>planning fallacy</em>.</p>
<p>Daniel Kahneman describes planning fallacy as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A phenomenon in which predictions about how much time will be needed to complete a future task display an optimism bias</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Rolf Dobelli clearly points out in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16248196-the-art-of-thinking-clearly">Art of thinking clearly</a> that we tend to ignore external factors, and overestimate internal factors when planning out things. That&rsquo;s exactly what I did when I planned for the year 2015, and laid the foundations of planning fallacy.</p>
<p>The journey of 2015 was bumpy, it was full of ups-and-downs. I stepped into a professional world, met new people, made good friends, learned cool things. However I was significantly diverted from one of the goals – open source contributions.</p>
<p>My open source journey started with my participation in Google Summer Of Code &lsquo;14. I contributed to many popular open source projects at that time. I had a GitHub commit streak of more than 200 days. Open source was a routine activity back then. Things changed since I started my full time job. It was difficult to take out time for open source activities. I always planned it for the <em>next day</em>. Alas, tomorrow never comes!</p>
<p>This is how my public contribution history looks now (personal account):</p>
<p><img src="/images/how-did-it-get-so-late-post/github-personal.png" alt="Github-personal"></p>
<p>And the contribution history of private repositories (work account):</p>
<p><img src="/images/how-did-it-get-so-late-post/github-work.png" alt="Github-personal"></p>
<p>I miss contributing to open source projects. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t like my new work, in fact I love it, love it more than anything. It&rsquo;s challenging and always a lot of learning is involved. But I miss the IRC chats, long discussions on public mailing lists, and the feeling of your patch being accepted (the BEST feeling ever).</p>
<p>With 2015 setting down, here I am, writing this post, and making another set of new year resolutions. But this time with a change. With a plan to not loose focus and to keep things simple. This time I&rsquo;m not going to repeat my mistake of creating a mammoth list. I will just limit it to four points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One commit a day – I will make at-least one public contribution daily. After all, one commit a day keeps the doctor away ;-)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn a new programming language – Starting from this year onwards I&rsquo;ll learn a new programming language every year. This year it will be one of Elixir, Go, or Ruby.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One blog post every month – Another thing which I messed up in 2015. At that time I <em>planned</em> to write a post ever week, bullshit!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get fit – Somehow the most important thing has has always been on a low priority for me. But this time it will change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you ever find me violating any of the above in 2016, just hit me hard. And I promise I&rsquo;ll treat you.</p>
