      <description>This post was originally posted on Medium as a part of life at Kayako series.
This summer I got the opportunity to do an internship as a Product Engineer at Kayako. I was fresh out of college and looking for a chance to apply the knowledge that I learned at college. I accepted the offer straight away.
The internship was the perfect platform to kick start my professional career. It not only honed my technical skills, but also helped me to the understand the various aspects of how an organization like this works.</description>
