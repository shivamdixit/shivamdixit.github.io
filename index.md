## Who am I ?

I am a second year undergraduate student and a web developer. I spend most of my time in front of my laptop writing softwares for personal enlightenment. I love to explore new technologies and always looking forward for challenging problems.

## Tell me something more

At present I am working for a software company as a back-end developer. I am an open source enthusiast and spend most of my free time writing code for [FOSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) community.

My area of interests include:

* Data Structures and Algorithms
* Web Development
* Machine Learning
* Application Security


## What is this blog about ?

This blog is about everything that is peeping in my head, mostly programming. I am not a professional blogger. I love to share my personal experiences and this blog is just for my satisfaction. If you have any suggestions feel free to drop me an email at `shivamd001 at gmail dot com`. Check out blog [Archive](archive.html)
