### About Me

I'm a Staff Software Engineer at [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com), making Databricks's systems more secure and reliable. I enjoy designing, implementing, and operating highly reliable services at scale. I have experience in both building and breaking applications, which also allows me to have a wider perspective on the problems. My role requires asking the right questions, using code as leverage, and solving not-so-well defined problems. Outside of tech, my interest lies in behavioral psychology, organizational behavior, and economics.
