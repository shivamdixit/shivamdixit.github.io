Another year is about to end and yet it seems it has just started. At the start of 2015, I had ambitious plans for the year. A lot of things to do, a plethora of resolutions, and a heart brimming with optimism. The year is about to conclude and I'm afraid that I'm far from my plans. I had fallen in the trap of *planning fallacy*.

Daniel Kahneman describes planning fallacy as follows:

> A phenomenon in which predictions about how much time will be needed to complete a future task display an optimism bias

As Rolf Dobelli clearly points out in his book [Art of thinking clearly](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16248196-the-art-of-thinking-clearly) that we tend to ignore external factors, and overestimate internal factors when planning out things. That's exactly what I did when I planned for the year 2015, and laid the foundations of planning fallacy.

The journey of 2015 was bumpy, it was full of ups-and-downs. I stepped into a professional world, met new people, made good friends, learned cool things. However I was significantly diverted from one of the goals – open source contributions.

My open source journey started with my participation in Google Summer Of Code '14. I contributed to many popular open source projects at that time. I had a GitHub commit streak of more than 200 days. Open source was a routine activity back then. Things changed since I started my full time job. It was difficult to take out time for open source activities. I always planned it for the _next day_. Alas, tomorrow never comes!

This is how my public contribution history looks now (personal account):

And the contribution history of private repositories (work account):

I miss contributing to open source projects. It's not that I don't like my new work, in fact I love it, love it more than anything. It's challenging and always a lot of learning is involved. But I miss the IRC chats, long discussions on public mailing lists, and the feeling of your patch being accepted (the BEST feeling ever).  

With 2015 setting down, here I am, writing this post, and making another set of new year resolutions. But this time with a change. With a plan to not loose focus and to keep things simple. This time I'm not going to repeat my mistake of creating a mammoth list. I will just limit it to four points:

* One commit a day – I will make at-least one public contribution daily. After all, one commit a day keeps the doctor away ;-)

* Learn a new programming language – Starting from this year onwards I'll learn a new programming language every year. This year it will be one of Elixir, Go, or Ruby.

* One blog post every month – Another thing which I messed up in 2015. At that time I _planned_ to write a post ever week, bullshit!

* Get fit – Somehow the most important thing has has always been on a low priority for me. But this time it will change.

If you ever find me violating any of the above in 2016, just hit me hard. And I promise I'll treat you.
